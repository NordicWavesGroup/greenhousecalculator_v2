A fully functioning B2C carbon calculator

- Functioning calculator(s) on the URL https://greenhousecalculator.com (URL owned by NWG)

- Inspiring, creative, and possibly innovative data visualizations of carbon emission results

- Ongoing communication with the team, especially founder Nicolai Alexandrowski, project manager Réka Kosztolányi, and other relevant members of the NWG team.

- If possible, creating  the function of "user profiles" for the B2C carbon calculator

- Guidelines for future/further developments for other developers

# the-calculator

-  User friendly CO2e calculator
-  Mobile design first = fast usability and perception of results, reactive interface, color maps, key words, numbers, unities

- Bottom horizontal navigation for the categories/spaces
- Focused on average emission factor by country or region
- Fast learning curve using visual queues 
- Our Goal is to allow users to calculate their Carbon Footprint emissions fast and that they can understand and internalised the scale of it.
